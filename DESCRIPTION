Package: SVAPLSseq
Type: Package
Title: SVAPLSseq-An R package to estimate the hidden factors of 
	 unwanted variability and adjust for them to enable a
	 more powerful and accurate differential expression analysis
	 based on RNAseq data
Description: The package contains functions that are intended for 
	  extracting the signatures of latent variation in RNAseq data
	  and using them to perform an improved differential expression
    	  analysis for a set of features (genes, transcripts) between
	  two specified biological groups.
